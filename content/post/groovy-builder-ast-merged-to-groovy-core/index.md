Hi!
Today it turned out that Paul King merged the Builder AST transform that based on my [PojoBuilder](https://github.com/groovy/groovy-core/pull/341) to core of Groovy. So you will be able to use it when the new version of Groovy gets released.
You can take a look at the code here
[https://github.com/groovy/groovy-core/pull/389](https://github.com/groovy/groovy-core/pull/389)
Many thanks go to [**Marcin ZajÄ…czkowski**](https://solidsoft.wordpress.com) for his code review to the initial version.
It's not the biggest features in the world but anyway, enjoy :)
