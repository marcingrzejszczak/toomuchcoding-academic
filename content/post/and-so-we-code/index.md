Hi! My name is Marcin and I'm a software developer at Rule Financial. Since I'm a coding addict when I'm not coding in Java I'm coding in Java. In addition to that I'm developing websites (including
[Ryszard Grzejszczak's Lawyer's office](https://www.grzejszczak.pl/)
,
[Center for Electoral Studies at University of Lodz](https://csw.uni.lodz.pl/)
,
[DF Private Financial Advisory](https://www.dfprivate.pl/)
). This blog will be about some of the issues that I found in my projects (the majority of those projects you can find on
[my website](https://www.marcin.grzejszczak.pl/)
) and the ways that I delt with them.
So... To all the coding junkies out there...
